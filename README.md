  ## Description
  This project is a Social Network API that uses MongoDB and node.js to keep track of users, inetractions and friends. My motivation was to make an application that allowed users to keep track of their friends, thoughts and reactions all in one place. This application allows the user to input all the inofrmation about their users and then save them to a database, they are also able to delete and add new users and friends. I have learned that using MongoDB to store databases and have them avaliable for use when needed is a great way to stay organized and have clean code.
